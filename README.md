# I think this subject will help me learn the basics and understand things better. I donâ€™t just want to memorize stuff and I want to know why things work the way they do. I hope we will do both lessons and activities so I can practice what I learn.

I also want to make projects and try things on my own, like small tasks or group work. I think practice will help me improve. I hope our tests will check how we solve problems and not just how much we remember. I also want to learn how to explain my answers well and make my work neat.

Lastly, I want to learn with my classmates and help each other. I think group work and sharing ideas will make learning more fun. At the end of this subject, I want to feel confident, know how to use the tools, and keep learning even when the class is done. I will do my best, ask questions when I need help, and be a good team player.
